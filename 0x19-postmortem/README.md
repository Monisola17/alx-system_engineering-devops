The root cause of the issue was a misconfigured database connection pool size. The connection pool was set to a lower value than required to handle the incoming traffic. As a result, the pool became exhausted, leading to slow query execution times and increased latency for users.

## Preventive measures

-Configuration Review: Conduct a thorough review of all system configurations to identify and address any misconfigured settings.
-Monitoring Enhancement: Implement proactive monitoring on database connection pool metrics to detect pool exhaustion and prevent similar incidents in the future.
-Load Testing: Regularly perform load testing to ensure that system resources, including database connection pools, can handle anticipated traffic loads.
-Automated Scaling: Implement automated scaling mechanisms to dynamically adjust resource allocation based on traffic patterns.
-Documentation Update: Maintain up-to-date documentation regarding configuration settings and their impact on system performance.
